# Short identifiers

| Code | Severity | i18n | Experimental |
| --- | --- | --- | :-: |
| short-identifiers | `Warning` | `sast_warnings.short_identifiers` | ‚ùå | 

## Introduction

JS-X-Ray store in memory all Identifiers so we are able later to sum the length of all of them. We are looking at several ESTree Node in the tree:
- VariableDeclarator: `var boo;`
- ClassDeclaration: `class boo {}`
- MethodDefinition
- AssignmentExpression: `(boo = 5)`
- FunctionDeclaration: `function boo() {}`
- Property of ObjectExpression: `{ boo: 5 }`

However, we do not take into consideration the properties of Objects for this warning. The warning is generated only if:

- The file is not already declared as **Minified**.
- There is more than **five** identifiers.
- The sum of all identifiers name length is below `1.5`.

## Example

```json
{
  "kind": "short-identifiers",
  "location": [[0,0], [0,0]],
  "value": 1.5,
  "file": "lib\\compile-env.js"
}
```
