# Unsafe Regex

| Code | Severity | i18n | Experimental |
| --- | --- | --- | :-: |
| unsafe-regex | `Warning` | `sast_warnings.unsafe_regex` | ❌ | 

## Introduction

This warning has been designed to detect and report any regular expressions (regexes) that could lead to a catastrophic backtracking.  This can be used by an attacker to drastically reduce the performance of your application. We often call this kind of attack REDOS.

### Technical implementation

Under the hood the package [safe-regex](https://github.com/davisjam/safe-regex) is used to assert all **RegExpLiteral** and RegEx Constructor (eg `new RegEx()`).

## Example

```json
{
  "kind": "unsafe-regex",
  "location": [[286,18],[286,65]],
  "value": "^node_modules\\/(@[^/]+\\/?[^/]+|[^/]+)(\\/.*)?$",
  "file": "index.js"
}
```
