## Introduction

Parsing Error is throw when the library [meriyah](https://github.com/meriyah/meriyah) fail to parse the javascript source code into an AST. But it can also happen when the AST analysis fails because we don't manage a case properly.

> **Note** If you are in the second case, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/NodeSecure/js-x-ray/issues)

## Example

```json
{
  "kind": "parsing-error",
  "value": "[10:30]: Unexpected token: ','",
  "location": [[0,0],[0,0]],
  "file": "helpers\\asyncIterator.js"
}
```
